\lettersection{Why PLACEHOLDER?}
\begin{cvletter}

	My past work experience was rewarding, but would not ultimately
	allow me to achieve my full potential.
	Tackling important challenges in the field of
	intelligent systems requires coordinated effort by a team of
	capable individuals, and at PLACEHOLDER I have the opportunity to be
	part of such a team. PLACEHOLDER's recent work on PLACEHOLDER is
	evidence of your organization's ability to effectively tackle novel
	challenges. Being able to learn from proven professionals of your
	caliber would be an invaluable experience.
