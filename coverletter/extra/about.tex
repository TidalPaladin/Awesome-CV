\lettersection{About Me}
\begin{cvletter}

	I am a computer science master's student at the University
	of Texas at Dallas and will be graduating in the spring of 2020. 
  During my graduate studies I have been involved in several academic and
  extracurricular projects while maintaining a \gpa{} GPA. Currently I am
  helping a research group design and implement computer vision networks 
  in Tensorflow with the aim of detecting microbubbles in ultrasound images.

  Prior to enrolling in graduate studies I operated a sole proprietorship
	that provided various IT and software development services on a
	contract basis. My responsibilities initially included
	the remote administration of computer and CCTV systems for locations
	across the state of Texas. 
	Through self-teaching of computer science concepts I would go on
	to tackle contracts that required the development of C++ and Python 
  software for edge devices and microcontrollers.
