\lettersection{About Me}
\begin{cvletter}

	I am currently a graduate computer science student at the University
	of Texas at Dallas with a focus on intelligent systems.
	Prior to beginning my graduate studies I operated a
	sole proprietership that provided various IT and software development
	services on a contract basis. My responsibilities initally included
	the remote administration of computer and CCTV systems for locations
	across the state of Texas. I would routinely need to convey abstract
	ideas and troubleshooting steps over the phone to individuals with
	little or no knowledge of computers. These roles honed my ability to
	solve problems and communicate effectively.
	Through self teaching of computer science concepts I would go on
	to tackle software development contracts with a focus on IoT
	applications. Specifically, I developed software and firmware in C,
	C++, and Python for both SBCs and microcontrollers.
